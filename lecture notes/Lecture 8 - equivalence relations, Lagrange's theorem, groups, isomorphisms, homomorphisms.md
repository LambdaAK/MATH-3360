# Lecture 8: Equivalence Relations, Lagrange's Theorem, Groups, Isomorphisms, Homomorphisms

**Summary:**
We continue our study of equivalence relations and groups. We prove Lagrange's theorem using cosets and equivalence relations. We use Lagrange's theorem to show that any group of prime order is cyclic. We introduce group isomorphisms and homomorphisms, proving that they preserve important group properties. We demonstrate that isomorphic groups have the same structure and prove that the order of elements is preserved under isomorphisms. We show that isomorphisms map identity elements to identity elements and that the inverse of an isomorphism is also an isomorphism.

**Topics Covered:** equivalence relation, group, homomorphism, isomorphism, Lagrange's theorem

**Lemma:** Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. For any $a, b \in G$, define the relation $a \sim b \iff a b ^ {-1} \in H$. Then, $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

**Lagrange's theorem:** Given a finite group $G$ and subgroup $H$, the cardinality of $H$ divides $G$.

**Proof:**

Recall that, given any element $a \in G$, we can define $H \space a \subseteq G$
$$Ha = \{h a \space | \space h \in H\}$$
Note that for $h, a \in G$, $ha$ is the product $h \cdot a$ in $H$.

For example
$$S_3 = G$$
$$H = \langle (1, 2) \rangle = \{e, (1, 2) \} = He = H(1, 2)$$
$$a = (1, 2, 3)$$
$$Ha = \{e(1, 2, 3), (1, 2)(1, 2, 3)\}$$
$$= \{(1, 2, 3), (1)(2, 3)\}$$

To prove claim 1, we will show that
1. $[a] \subseteq Ha$
2. $[a] \supseteq Ha$

We have
1. $x \in [a] : x \sim a \iff x a ^ {-1} \in H \iff a x ^ {-1}$
2. $x \in Ha \implies x = ha$ for some $h \in H$ : $x a ^ {-1} = ha a ^ {-1} = h \in H$

We need to prove that $x \sim a \iff x a ^ {-1} \in H$.

**Claim 1:** $[a] = Ha$

**Claim 2:** $|Ha| = |H|$, because of the cancellation property - $\forall a \in G . \space (\forall b, c \in G . \space ab = ac) \implies \forall b, c \in G . \space b = c$

**Corollary:**

Let $G$ be a finite group of order $n$ (this means $|G| = n$). Then,
1. $\forall a \in G. \space \sigma(a) \space | \space n$
2. $\forall a \in G . \space a ^ n = e$

**Proof:**

Let $a \in G$ and let $H = \langle a \rangle$ be the cyclic group generated by $a$. We showed last time that $|\langle a \rangle | = \sigma(a)$.

Thus, since $\langle a \rangle$ is a subgroup of $G \implies \sigma(a) \space | \space |G| = n$

1. $\forall k \in \mathbb{Z} . \space \left ( a ^ {\sigma(a)}\right ) ^k = e$

**Corollary:**

Any group of prime order is cyclic.

**Proof:**

Let $G$ be a group with prime order $|G| = p$. This means
$$\forall a \in G. \space \sigma(a) \space| \space p \implies \sigma(a) = 1 \text{ or } \sigma(a) = p$$
Only $e$ is of order 1 means
$$\exists a \in G . \space \sigma(a) = p \implies | \langle a \rangle | = p, \langle a \rangle \subseteq G \implies G = \langle a \rangle$$
$$QED$$

$$G = \{e, a, a ^ 2, a ^ 3, a ^ 4, a ^ 5 ,a ^ 6 \}$$
$$a ^ 7 = e$$
- $\sigma(a ^. 2) = 7$
- $\sigma (a ^ 3) = 7$
- $\sigma (a ^ 4) = 7$
- $\sigma(a ^ 5) = 7$
- $\sigma(a ^ 6) = 7$

This is because $7$ is prime. Therefore, every element in $G$ except for $e$ is a generator of $G$.

**Definition:**

Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups and let $\phi : G_1 \rightarrow G_2$ be a function. $\phi$ is a group isomorphism means
1. $\phi$ is a bijection
2. $\phi(ab) = \phi(a) \phi(b)$
	- On the left, multiplication is in $G_1$
	- On the right, multiplication is in $G_2$

When such a $\phi$ exists, we say that $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$ and we write $G_1 \cong G_2$. This essentially means the groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ are the same group with the same structure, but with differently-named elements.

**Example:**

$$G = \langle a \rangle, \space \space \sigma(a) = 7$$
$$\phi : G \rightarrow \langle (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ) \rangle$$
$$\phi(a) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)$$
$$\phi(a) ^ 2 = \left ( \phi(a) \right ) ^ 2$$
Here, $\phi$ is a group isomorphism.

**Definition:**

Let $G_1$, $G_2$ be groups. A homomorphism is a function $\phi : G_1 \rightarrow G_2$ such that $\forall a, b \in G _1 . \space \phi(ab) = \phi(a) \phi(b)$.

| $\cdot$   | $e$         | $a$         | $a ^ 2$     | $b$      | $ab$     | $a ^ 2 b$ |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| $e$       | $(1)(2)(3)$ | $(1, 2, 3)$ | $(1, 3, 2)$ | $(1, 2)$ | $(1, 3)$ | $(2, 3)$  |
| $a$       |             |             |             |          |          |           |
| $a ^ 2$   |             |             |             |          |          |           |
| $b$       |             |             |             |          |          |           |
| $ab$      |             |             |             |          |          |           |
| $a ^ 2 b$ |             |             |             |          |          |           |

This creates an isomorphism.

**Proposition:**

Let $\phi : G_1 \rightarrow G_2$ be a group isomorphism. Then,
1. $\forall a \in G . \space \sigma _ {G_1}(a) = \sigma _ {G_2} (\phi(a))$
2. If $G_1$ is abelian (commutative), so is $G_2$
3. If $G_1$ is cyclic, then $G_2$ is cyclic

Note that for an isomorphism $\phi : G_1 \rightarrow G_2$ with $e_1 \in G_1$ and $e_2 \in G_2$ identity elements, we have $\phi(e_1) = e_2$. This is shown by verifying that $\phi(e_1) \in G_2$ is an identity element of $G_2$. Then, by the uniqueness of identity elements, we know that $e_2 = \phi(e_1)$, so they are indeed the same element.

Since $\phi$ is an isomorphism, there exists an inverse isomorphism that maps $\phi(a) \mapsto a$.

Therefore,
$$\sigma(\phi(a)) \space | \space \sigma(a)$$
and
$$\sigma(a) \space | \space \sigma(\phi(a))$$
Therefore,
$$\sigma(a) = \sigma(\phi(a))$$
