# Lecture 15: Modular Congruence

**Summary:**
We continue our study of modular arithmetic, examining the structure of integers modulo m. We prove that the invertible group of integers modulo m consists of integers coprime to m, and establish conditions for the existence of multiplicative inverses.

**Topics Covered:** modular congruence relation, modular congruence ring

For a positive integer $m$, we define
$$\mathbb{Z} _ m = \{[a]_m \space : \space a \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \{[0]_m , [1]_m, \space .... \space, [m - 1] _m\}$$
to be the set of equivalence classes of $\mathbb{Z}$ under the equivalence relation
$$a \sim b \iff m \space | \space a - b$$
We checked last class that addition and multiplication defined on $\mathbb{Z}$ in the obvious way
$$[a]_m + [b]_m = [a + b] _m$$
$$[a]_m \cdot [b]_m = [ab]_m$$
is well-defined.

**Lemma:**

$(\mathbb{Z}_m, +)$ is a group

**Example:**

The addition table for $(\mathbb{Z}_3, +)$ is


| $+$     | $[0]_3$ | $[1]_3$ | $[2]_3$ |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| $[0]_3$ | $[0]_3$ | $[1]_3$ | $[2]_3$ |
| $[1]_3$ | $[1]_3$ | $[2]_3$ | $[0]_3$ |
| $[2]_3$ | $[2]_3$ | $[0]_3$ | $[1]_3$ |

**Example:**

The addition table for $(\mathbb{Z}_4, +)$ is

**Lemma:**

The cyclic group $(\mathbb{Z}_m,+)$ is generated by $[a]_m$ $\iff$ $\gcd(a, m) = 1$.


**Proof:**

If $\gcd(a, m) = 1$, then we can use Bezout's theorem to write $1$ as a linear combination of $a$ and $m$. This shows that $[1]_m \in \langle [a]_m \rangle$, so $[a]_m$ generates all of $\mathbb{Z}_m$.

Conversely, if $\gcd(a, b) = d > 1$, then everything generated by $[a]_m$ is a multiple of $d$. In particular, you cannot reach $[1]_m$.
$$\text{QED}$$

**Lemma:**
$$(\mathbb{Z}_m , \cdot)$$ is a monoid.

Note that $[0]_m$ is never invertible in $(\mathbb{Z}_m, \cdot)$.

Recall that the grou pof units in a monoid $(M, \cdot)$ is the set
$$M ^ \times = \{x \in M \space : \space x \text{ is invertible}\}$$

We saw many lectrues ago that $(M ^ \times, \cdot)$ is always a group, What does that group look like for $\mathbb{Z}_m$?

**Lemma:**

$$\mathbb{Z}_m ^ \times = \{[a]_m \space : \space \gcd(a, b) = 1\}$$
Here, we are looking for elements $[a]_m$ which are invertible. In particular, these are the elements such that there exists $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $[a]_m[x]_m = [1]_m$.

This is the same as requiring $[ax]_m = [1]_m$, which in trun is the same as $$ax \equiv 1 \space (\text{mod} \space m)$$
**Proposition:**

Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then,
1. $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $ax \equiv 1 \space ( \text{mod} \space m)$ $\iff$ $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and
2. Such an $x$ is unique modulo $m$
